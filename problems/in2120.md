## Problem
You are walking with your friend to stumble upon an old computer that looks like something a century old but somehow it
still has an old script that works. You and your friend start inputting random numbers into it and it either outputs
True or False. You and your friend start wondering about the algorithm behind this old mystery piece of tech and go in
to try to solve it.

```python
>>> solution(902200100)
... True
>>> solution(11000)
... False
>>> solution(99080)
... True
>>> solution(1022220)
... True
>>> solution(106611)
... True
>>> solution(234230)
... False
>>> solution(888)
... False
>>> solution(100)
... False
>>> solution(1000000000)
... False
>>> solution(103456789) 
... True
```

## Solution

Unfortunately, there isn't a witful solution nor a particular process for finding the solution to this challenge. It
will come through inspection.


### Pattern

    Any number containing a zero followed by non-zeros is true.


We know that zeroes do not appear at the beginning of numbers unless a decimal, however we're dealing with integers.
Therefore, if we remove all zeros at the tail of the number and there is still a zero inside, we return `True`. 
Else, `False`.


### Code
```python
solution=lambda x: '0'in str(x).strip('0')
```
