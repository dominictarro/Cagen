Steps:
1) Place your code in the file 'solution.py'
2) Make sure your function accepts all arguments as described in the problem
3) Run main.py

Note:
	a) Solutions that take longer than the time limit will be terminated. You will still receive the performance
	and validity results for the cases you did complete.
	b) Input and output is flagged and blocked
	c) Solution calls outside of the tester will be flagged
	d) Import statements are flagged
	3) Do not use docstrings in your solution except for comments, they are removed for runtime (3 " or 3 ')
